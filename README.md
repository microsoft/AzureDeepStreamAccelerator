# Azure DeepStream Accelerator overview

Azure DeepStream Accelerator includes developer tools that provide a custom developer experience. It enables you to create NVIDIA DeepStream containers using Microsoft-based images and guidance, supported models from NVIDIA out of the box, and/or bring your own models.

DeepStream is NVIDIA’s toolkit to develop and deploy Vision AI applications and services. It provides multi-platform, scalable, Transport Layer Security (TLS)-encrypted security that can be deployed on-premises, on the edge, and in the cloud.

## Azure DeepStream Accelerator offers:

- **Simplifying your development process**

  Auto selection of AI model execution and inference provider: One of several execution providers, such as ORT, CUDA, and TENSORT, are automatically selected to simplify your development process.

- **Customizing Region of Interest (ROI) to enable your business scenario**

  Region of Interest (ROI) configuration widget: Azure DeepStream Accelerator Player, a web app widget, is included for customizing ROIs to enable event detection for your business scenario.

- **Simplifying the configuration for pre/post processing**

  You can add a Python-based model parser using a configuration file, instead of hardcoding it into the pipeline.

- **Offering a broad Pre-built AI model framework**

  This solution supports many of the most common CV models in use today, for example NVIDIA TAO, ONNX, CAFFE, UFF (TensorFlow), and Triton.

- **Supporting bring your own model**

  Support for model/container customization, USB/RTSP camera and pre-recorded video stream(s), event-based video snippet storage in Azure Storage and Alerts, and AI model deployment via Azure IoT Module Twin update.

- **Support for Multiple Trackers**

  Support for NV Tracker and Light trackers (https://github.com/researchmm/LightTrack).

## Azure DeepStream Accelerator architecture

The following diagram provides a high-level view of the Azure DeepStream Accelerator architecture.

![azure_deepstream_accelerator_architecture](./documentation/media/azure_deepstream_accelerator_architecture.png)

* **AI-Pipeline Container**: The AI Pipeline Container is the heart of Azure DeepStream Accelerator. It ingests USB or RTSP camera streams and applies AI models to the video frames.
  The outputs of the models are multiplexed together and then sent out to the Business Logic Container for user logic to handle. There are a few points of configuration for this
  container: [AI models can be delivered to it or packaged up into it](./documentation/tutorial-prebuiltmodel-path.md#step-3-prepare-and-upload-your-container),
  AI models can make use of [Tensor RT or any runtime that Triton Inference Server can utilize](./documentation/how-to-usecommandlinetool.md#model-compatability-matrix), and
  which cameras are used for which AI model configurations can be configured via the [Controller's module twin](./documentation/how-to-configcontroller.md).
* **Controller Module**: This container is responsible for configuring the whole system. See [the documentation for the full configuration API](./documentation/how-to-configcontroller.md)
* **Business Logic Container (BLC)**: This is where a user's application logic should live. It can be configured through the [Controller Module](./documentation/how-to-configcontroller.md).
  It should accept inferences from the AI Pipeline Container and do whatever user logic to those inferences, then send back a switch on/off for recording event snippets.
  [See more about the BLC here.](./documentation/how-to-modifybusinesslogic.md)
* **Video Uploader**: The Video Uploader Container is responsible for taking inferences and MP4 video snippets and uploading them to the cloud. These uploads are triggered by the Business Logic Container telling
  the AI Pipeline Container when to upload video. The video is delivered by means of a common volume shared between the AI Pipeline and the Video Uploader.
* **Azure DeepStream Accelerator Player**: The Player is a Java Script widget that provides a convenient way to view video snippets that are found in the user's connected Blob Storage.
  It can also define regions of interest graphically, in case that is of use for the end user's application logic. [See here for more information about the Player](./documentation/how-to-usewebappwidget.md).
